    <p>
      VoiceMask was a Discord bot I made back in August 2020. Discord has a feature called voice
      channels, which are mini spaces for voice chat. Although they are quite useful, for those that
      do not have a mic or feel uncomfortable talking in a voice channel, voice channels quickly
      become limitations.
    </p>

    <p>
      In short, VoiceMask was a text-to-speech bot: users typed what they wanted to say and then the
      bot would say it out loud in the voice channel.
    </p>

    <p>At its peak, VoiceMask reached 1,500 Discord servers and served thousands of users.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately I had to take it down as the costs to host it became too high.</p>

    <p>
      However, despite the fact that I had to take it down, I learned a lot from building it and
      watching it grow.
    </p>

    <p>
      What amazes me to this day is the ways VoiceMask was used. For example, one community used the
      bot to hold a local dating session. Participants got to know each other by talking through the
      bot, with the goal being that the participants would put in the effort to learn about each
      other's personalities and base their decisions on those interactions, rather than on physical
      traits which may warrant implicit bias. I would have never thought that people could use my
      simple Discord bot to find love.
