Enabling FTP in Linux is actually really simple and not that daunting.
Here is a quick, simple tutorial on how to enable FTP in Linux!

## Installation

Our first step is to install `vsftpd`. We can do this by running:

```bash
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install vsftpd
```

Now after we install it, we need to start it. To do this, run:

```bash
sudo systemctl start vsftpd
sudo systemctl enable vsftpd
```

And that's the basic setup! You now should have an FTP server up and running!

## Configuration

This part is optional really, since most of the configuration settings that are essential
are already enabled but it's really important to know about configuring vsftpd.

First, before we configure vsftpd, lets make a backup of the original configuration file:

```bash
sudo cp /etc/vsftpd.conf /etc/vsftpd.conf.original
```

And configuring the file is just a matter of opening up the configuration file!
Remember that the location of the configuration file is at `/etc/vsftpd.conf`

## Basic Setup of the Configuration File

To disable anonymous login and to enable local users login and give them write permissions:

```bash title="/etc/vsftpd.conf"
# No anonymous login
anonymous_enable=NO

# Let local users login
# If you connect from the internet with local users, you should enable TLS/SSL/FTPS
local_enable=YES

# Write permissions
write_enable=YES
```

To deny some users to login, add the following options in the end of the file:

```bash title="/etc/vsftpd.conf"
userlist_deny=YES
userlist_file=/etc/vsftpd.denied_users
```

To allow just some users to login:

```bash title="/etc/vsftpd.conf"
userlist_deny=NO
userlist_enable=YES
userlist_file=/etc/vsftpd.allowed_users
```

To use vsftpd with encryption (it's safer), change or add the following options
(some options aren't on the original config file, so add them):

```bash title="/etc/vsftpd.conf"
ssl_enable=YES
allow_anon_ssl=NO
force_local_data_ssl=YES
force_local_logins_ssl=YES
ssl_tlsv1=YES
ssl_sslv2=YES
ssl_sslv3=YES

# Filezilla uses port 21 if you don't set any port
# in Servertype "FTPES - FTP over explicit TLS/SSL"
# Port 990 is the default used for FTPS protocol.
# Uncomment it if you want/have to use port 990.

# listen_port=990
```

Here are other additional options that may come handy:

```bash title="/etc/vsftpd.conf"
# Show hidden files and the "." and ".." folders.
# Useful to not write over hidden files:
force_dot_files=YES

# Hide the info about the owner (user and group) of the files.
hide_ids=YES

# Connection limit for each IP:
max_per_ip=2

# Maximum number of clients:
max_clients=20
```

## Apply Configuration Changes

If you have modified the configuration file, remember that we need to apply them! To do this, run:

```bash
sudo /etc/init.d/vsftpd restart
```

And that is pretty much it for this tutorial! You now successfully
have enabled FTP/SFTP on Linux! I hope this tutorial helped you!
