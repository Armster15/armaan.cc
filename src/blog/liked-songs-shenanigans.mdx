---

import Aside from "$/components/Aside.astro";

I have a friend who has built up an amazing collection of songs on Spotify. They did this by over the years simply using the ‚ÄúLike‚Äù feature when they like a song. As a result, they have a collection of over a thousand songs representing their diverse music taste.

When I learned about this, I became jealous. I too wanted such a collection, but I didn‚Äôt want to wait years for it to build up into something formidable.

For a couple of years now I‚Äôve been using [Last.fm](https://last.fm). It‚Äôs overall pretty nice: it tracks everything you listen to automatically, meaning you can set it up once and never touch it again and it‚Äôll still continue collecting the data for you.

Since I was already using Last.fm, I thought why not I get my data from the site and put all the songs I‚Äôve determined to ‚Äúlike‚Äù into my Liked Songs?

## Part 1: Getting My Data

First I needed to get my data from Last.fm. I [stumbled upon](https://www.reddit.com/r/lastfm/comments/mfz407/i_created_a_lastfm_statistics_website/) a project called [lastfmstats.com](http://lastfmstats.com). It‚Äôs a really cool website: I highly recommend checking it out for its own merits as the graphs and the analyses it provides are quite fascinating. For the sake of this post, however, we will be using it simply to get our data in a machine-readable format.

Simply type your Last.fm username and let it do its thing. Depending on how many scrobbles you have it may take a while for it to collect your data but after it finishes you have the option to download your scrobbles as a JSON file.

Now that we have our data, let‚Äôs get to processing it!

## Part 2: Processing My Scrobbles

I used Python for my scripting, so I will use Python in this post as well, but really you can use anything.

To note ahead of time, ‚Äúdicts‚Äù in Python are simply key-value stores. Since the scripts are written in Python, I will be using the word ‚Äúdict‚Äù throughout the post, but just know it can be any key-value store in your respective language.

First, let‚Äôs load our JSON file into a variable called `contents`:

```python
with open("./lastfmstats.json", "r") as f:
	# Rough schema of the `contents` dict
	# {
	# 	username: string;
	# 	scrobbles: {
	# 		track: string;
	# 		artist: string;
	# 		album: string;
	# 		date: number; // Unix epoch
	# 	}[]
	# }
	contents = json.load(f)
```

Now let‚Äôs get how many times a track has been scrobbled:

```python
times_track_scrobbled = {} # { [serialized_track: string]: number }

for scrobble in contents["scrobbles"]:
	key = serialize_track(scrobble["track"], scrobble["artist"])

	if key in times_track_scrobbled:
		times_track_scrobbled[key] = times_track_scrobbled[key] + 1
	else:
		times_track_scrobbled[key] = 1
```

<Aside icon={{text: "‚ùì"}}>
**‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up with the `serialize_track` stuff?‚Äù**

To differentiate tracks we need to consider both the track‚Äôs name and the artist. There are a million songs out there named ‚ÄúDie for You‚Äù for example. However, we can‚Äôt use dicts as keys of dicts. We could make the key something like `track_name + " - " + artist_name` but I needed to be able to retrieve the artist name and title and wasn‚Äôt comfortable with this simple concatenation since I was dealing with unknown data (what if the track or artist had a dash in their names?). Therefore, I created the following two methods:

```python
import json

# This serializing/deserializing logic is required because we can't use dicts as keys for dicts

def serialize_track(title: str, artist: str):
	# `ensure_ascii` flag required to __not__ turn something like "Â§ú" to "\u591c"
	return json.dumps({ "title": title, "artist": artist }, ensure_ascii=False)

def deserialize_track(serialized_str: str):
	return json.loads(serialized_str)
```

As you can see, it‚Äôs nothing crazy complicated: just two methods that turn JSON into a string and vice versa. Slight over-engineering but it does the job ü§∑

</Aside>

Now we have a dict that maps each song we have ever listened to to how many times in total we‚Äôve listened to it.

## Part 3: Filtering Tracks

We don‚Äôt like every song we‚Äôve ever scrobbled. Therefore, we need to narrow down our list to the tracks we actually like. We could manually review every song, but I decided to try to automate as much of this as possible.

My methodology was as follows:

- Songs that had 35 or more scrobbles were ‚Äúfor sure‚Äù likes. These were automatic adds.
- Songs that had 10 or more scrobbles but less than 35 were ‚Äúquestionable‚Äù likes. These I would manually review to see whether I actually liked them or not.
- Songs below 10 scrobbles would not be included whatsoever.

Of course, everyone is different, so pick different numbers. I settled on these numbers by going through my Last.fm library and generalizing around what scrobble count I was confident in a song and what scrobble count it seemed more fuzzy.

There is one major flaw with this: just because you don‚Äôt listen to a song 10 or more times doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you don‚Äôt like it. However, personally I was fine with this compromise; after all it would be unrealistic to expect a perfect collection from automation.

Here is an implementation of the filtering:

```python
# Edit as you please
THRESHOLD_FOR_SURE = 35
THRESHOLD_FOR_QUESTIONABLE = 10

# { title: string; artist: string; times_scrobbled: number; threshold: "questionable" | "for_sure" }
filtered_tracks = []

# Iterate through the dict, where first param is the key while the second is the value
for serialized_track, times_scrobbled in times_track_scrobbled.items():
	track = deserialize_track(serialized_track)

	if times_scrobbled >= THRESHOLD_FOR_SURE:
		filtered_tracks.append({
			"title": track["title"],
			"artist": track["artist"],
			"times_scrobbled": times_scrobbled,
			"threshold": "for_sure",
		})

	elif times_scrobbled >= THRESHOLD_FOR_QUESTIONABLE:
		filtered_tracks.append({
			"title": track["title"],
			"artist": track["artist"],
			"times_scrobbled": times_scrobbled,
			"threshold": "questionable",
		})

```

I then sorted `filtered_tracks` by the total number of times I listened to a song purely for organization purposes, split the `filtered_tracks` list into two lists: `questionable_tracks` and `for_sure_tracks`, and then dumped the contents of these two lists into two JSON files:

```python
# Sort `filtered_tracks` by number of times a song has been listened to
filtered_tracks.sort(key=lambda x: x["times_scrobbled"], reverse=False)

# Split `filtered_tracks` into two lists: `questionable_tracks` and `for_sure_tracks`
questionable_tracks = list(filter(lambda x: x["threshold"] == "questionable", filtered_tracks))
for_sure_tracks = list(filter(lambda x: x["threshold"] == "for_sure", filtered_tracks))

# Dump the contents of the two lists into JSON files
with open("./for_sure_tracks.json", "w") as f:
	json.dump(for_sure_tracks, f, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)
with open("./questionable_tracks.json", "w") as f:
	json.dump(questionable_tracks, f, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)

```

Now we end up with two files: `for_sure_tracks.json` and `questionable_tracks.json`.

I left the ‚Äúfor sure‚Äù tracks file as is. As for the file with the ‚Äúquestionable‚Äù tracks, I just went ahead and manually removed songs that I did not deem fit to be added to my Liked Songs collection.

And with that, filtering my data has been done!

## Part 4: Dumping the Songs into Spotify

We now have two files containing the songs we want to dump into our Liked Songs collection. Let‚Äôs now actually import our songs into Spotify!

First, get a token you can use to authenticate yourself with the API. I simply went to the [Spotify for Developers website](https://developer.spotify.com/) and scrolled down to the ‚ÄúSee it in action‚Äù section, where there is an auth token of mine I could use to authenticate.

Next, I created a new playlist and found its ID by opening the playlist in the Spotify web app and investigating its URL:

```bash
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/<id> # <- <id> is what you want
```

<Aside icon={{text: "‚ùì"}}>
**Wasn‚Äôt this blog post on liked songs?**

Yes, but when scripting I first dumped them all into a separate playlist so if in some case something goes wrong it‚Äôs easy to just delete the playlist and start over. After I made sure the playlist seemed good I then dumped that playlist to my liked songs.

</Aside>

Let‚Äôs now load back the two JSON files we created:

```python
# {
# 	"title": string,
#   "artist": string,
#   "times_scrobbled": number,
#   "threshold": "for_sure" | "questionable"
# }[]
tracks_data = []

with open("./for_sure_tracks.json") as f:
	tracks_data = tracks_data + json.load(f)
with open("./questionable_tracks.json") as f:
	tracks_data = tracks_data + json.load(f)
```

Now the next step we‚Äôd want to do is iterate through each song and add each song to our playlist. Seems easy right?

Things get slightly weird here.

### Dealing with Spotify URIs

If you wish to add a song to a playlist via the Spotify API, the API expects that you provide the Spotify URI of that song.

For example, the Spotify URI of ‚ÄúNever Gonna Give You Up‚Äù by Rick Astley is `spotify:track:4PTG3Z6ehGkBFwjybzWkR8`

As one can see, the Spotify URI for a track is composed of the song‚Äôs ID with a prefix of `spotify:track:`

But our data does not have the Spotify URIs of each track: we only know the track‚Äôs title and the artist.

This means that before we can add songs from our data to a playlist, we must figure out their Spotify URIs.

#### Option 1: Searching the Spotify API

The Spotify API has a [`/search` endpoint](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/search) which you can use to search songs by a query, similar to how you search normally. We can use this API endpoint to search for a song and then get its Spotify URI:

```python
import requests
import time

SPOTIFY_TOKEN = ""

def search_track_on_spotify(title: str, artist: str):
	query = title + " " + artist

	# This is the important part
	r = requests.get(
		"https://api.spotify.com/v1/search",
		params={
			"q": query,
			"type": "track",
		},
		headers={
			"Authorization": "Bearer " + SPOTIFY_TOKEN
		}
	)

	# If an error occurred
	if r.status_code >= 400:
		# If we've been rate limited sleep until rate limit is over
		if "Retry-After" in r.headers:
			sleep_time = int(r.headers["Retry-After"])
		# If it's something else just sleep for 20 seconds
		else:
			sleep_time = 20

		print(f"Error occurred searching for song on Spotify for {title} by {artist}. Trying again after {sleep_time}s...", r.status_code)
		time.sleep(sleep_time)
		return search_track_on_spotify(title, artist)

	data = r.json()

	raw_track = data["tracks"]["items"][0]

	return {
		"title": raw_track["name"],
		"spotify_link": raw_track["external_urls"]["spotify"],
		"spotify_uri": raw_track["uri"],
		"spotify_id": raw_track["id"],
		"artist_name": raw_track["artists"][0]["name"],
		"album_name": raw_track["album"]["name"],
		"album_type": raw_track["album"]["album_type"],
	}

```

Then getting the Spotify URIs for each song should be a piece of cake:

```python
track_uris = []
for raw_track in tracks_data:
	track = search_track_on_spotify(raw_track["title"], raw_track["artist"])
	track_uris.append(track["spotify_uri"])
```

Although this approach works well in cases where there are not many tracks, in cases where you are dealing with hundreds or possibly thousands of unique tracks, this method crumbles thanks to everyone‚Äôs favorite friend: rate limiting.

[Spotify doesn‚Äôt have a fixed rate limit](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/rate-limits): it is calculated automatically based on the number of requests made in a 30 second time frame. This isn‚Äôt fun since this means that we can‚Äôt write a specific back off plan in order to avoid getting rate limited.

Additionally, the search API does not provide a way to batch requests, which means we have to send one HTTP request for every song, which scales terribly when you are dealing with large song counts as you will be forced to deal with rate limits.

When I first ran my script querying the Spotify API for every track, it worked for approximately the first 400 or 500 tracks, but then I got rate limited for 24 hours. This is not ideal whatsoever, so this option isn‚Äôt great.

#### Option 2: Getting Spotify URIs from Last.fm

If you‚Äôve ever used the Last.fm website, you may have noticed that the webpages for tracks contain the URLs of various streaming services where you can listen to the track.

This is wonderful since this means that we can get our Spotify URIs from Last.fm and avoid dealing with the rate limits of Spotify.

Unfortunately, the Last.fm API doesn‚Äôt seem to have a method to retrieve these URLs, so we will resort to web scraping.

As of writing, the `a` tag which links to the Spotify URL of the song has a class of `play-this-track-playlink--spotify`. If this ever changes you can always use the DevTools of your browser to see what HTML attributes and classes can be used to identify the Spotify link.

Here is a method that retrieves the Spotify URI for a track via scraping Last.fm:

```python
from urllib.parse import quote as encode_uri_component
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as BSoup
import time

def get_spotify_uri_of_song_from_lastfm(title: str, artist: str):
	url = f"https://www.last.fm/music/{encode_uri_component(artist)}/_/{encode_uri_component(title)}"

	# Fetch raw HTML
	r = requests.get(url)

	# Handle errors
	if r.status_code >= 400:
		if r.status_code == 404:
			print(f"Couldn't find {title} by {artist}. SKIPPING.")
			return None

		elif r.status_code == 429:
			if "Retry-After" in r.headers:
				sleep_time = int(r.headers["Retry-After"])
			else:
				sleep_time = 20

			print(f"Rate limited when searching Last.fm for {title} by {artist}. Trying again after {sleep_time}s...", r.status_code)
			time.sleep(sleep_time)
			return get_spotify_uri_of_song_from_lastfm(title, artist)

		else:
			print(f"Unexpected error occurred searching Last.fm for {title} by {artist}. SKIPPING.", r.status_code)
			return None

	# Convert raw HTML into a "soup" that is traversable
	soup = BSoup(r.text, 'html.parser')

	# Select all `a` elements with the class `play-this-track-playlink--spotify`
	all_spotify_links = soup.find_all("a", class_="play-this-track-playlink--spotify")

	if len(all_spotify_links) <= 0:
		return None

	spotify_web_url = all_spotify_links[0]["href"] # Will be something like https://open.spotify.com/track/4PTG3Z6ehGkBFwjybzWkR8
	spotify_id = spotify_web_url.split("/")[-1] # Extract spotify id

	return f"spotify:track:{spotify_id}" # Compose the spotify URI
```

Although we're still making one HTTP request for every song, Last.fm seems to be far more tolerant than Spotify. In my case I never ran into rate limits, but if you do end up running into rate limits from Last.fm, proxies could potentially be used as a workaround since we are simply making unauthenticated GET requests.

### Getting the Spotify URIs

We now have two options to determine the Spotify URI of a track. Retrieving the URI via Last.fm is overall much better as it avoids the rate limits of Spotify. However, that doesn‚Äôt mean Option 1 won‚Äôt be used: not all Last.fm pages have the respective Spotify links, so for the tracks where Last.fm doesn't provide a Spotify link, we will use Spotify‚Äôs API to search for the URI.

```python
track_uris = []

for raw_track in tracks_data:
	# First try to retrieve Spotify URI from Last.fm
	track_uri = get_spotify_uri_of_song_from_lastfm(raw_track["title"], raw_track["artist"])

	# If failed, retrieve Spotify URI via Spotify's `/search` API
	if track_uri == None:
		print(f"{raw_track["title"]} {raw_track["artist"]} - Track uri not found; fetching from Spotify")
		spotify_track = search_track_on_spotify(raw_track["title"], raw_track["artist"])
		track_uris.append(spotify_track["spotify_uri"])
		print("RAW: ", raw_track["title"], raw_track["artist"], "| SPOTIFY: ", spotify_track["title"], spotify_track["artist_name"])

	else:
		track_uris.append(track_uri)
		print(f"Found track uri for {raw_track["title"]} {raw_track["artist"]}")

```

<Aside icon={{ text: "‚ö†Ô∏è", "aria-label": "Warning" }}>
  The Spotify search results are not perfect. You might get the incorrect Spotify URI and therefore
  the incorrect song added to your playlist. Although annoying, you may have to manually review the
  results to verify if the right songs have been added.
</Aside>

### Dumping the Spotify URIs into the Playlist

Now that we have a list of Spotify URIs, lets actually add them to our playlist:

```python
SPOTIFY_TOKEN = ""
PLAYLIST_ID = ""

def add_songs_to_playlist(spotify_uris: list[str]):
	r = requests.post(
		f"https://api.spotify.com/v1/playlists/{PLAYLIST_ID}/tracks",
		json={
			"uris": spotify_uris
		},
		headers={
			"Authorization": "Bearer " + SPOTIFY_TOKEN
		}
	)

	# If error occurred
	if r.status_code >= 400:
		# If we've been rate limited sleep until rate limit is over
		if "Retry-After" in r.headers:
			sleep_time = int(r.headers["Retry-After"])
		# If it's something else just sleep for 20 seconds
		else:
			sleep_time = 20

		print(f"Error occurred for adding songs to playlist. Trying again after {sleep_time}s...", r.status_code)
		time.sleep(sleep_time)
		return add_songs_to_playlist(spotify_uris)

	print(f"Added {len(spotify_uris)} songs to playlist", r)

# We can send up to 100 songs in one HTTP request, so just create batches of
# 99 Spotify URIs and send them out

batched_track_uris = []

for uri in track_uris:
	batched_track_uris.append(uri)

	if len(batched_track_uris) >= 99:
		add_songs_to_playlist(batched_track_ids)
		batched_track_uris = []
		time.sleep(0.5)

if len(batched_track_uris) > 0:
		add_songs_to_playlist(batched_track_ids)
		batched_track_uris = []
		time.sleep(0.5)
```

You should end up with a playlist with all of the tracks that will compose your ‚ÄúLiked Songs‚Äù collection! At this point I recommend making sure that the right songs were added and fixing the songs that Spotify or Last.fm provided an incorrect Spotify URI for.

## Part 5: Dumping the Playlist into Liked Songs

We have a nice playlist, but it‚Äôs a playlist: our goal is to add these songs to our Liked Songs collection.

This is just a matter of writing a script that fetches all the songs in our current playlist, then likes them so they get saved in our Liked Songs collection:

```python
import requests
import time

SPOTIFY_TOKEN = ""
PLAYLIST_ID = ""

spotify_track_ids = []

# Method that likes songs
# Pass a list of Spotify IDs (ex: "4PTG3Z6ehGkBFwjybzWkR8")
# Note: Spotify URIs != Spotify IDs!
def like_song_ids(ids: list[str]):
	r = requests.put(
		"https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/tracks",
		json={
			"ids": ids
		},
		headers={
			"Authorization": "Bearer " + SPOTIFY_TOKEN
		}
	)

	print(f"Dumped {len(ids)} in liked songs", r)

# Get all the songs from a playlist
# We aren't able to get all the songs in one HTTP request: we have to send multiple requests
def recursively_get_spotify_track_ids_from_playlist(url=f"https://api.spotify.com/v1/playlists/{PLAYLIST_ID}/tracks"):
	r = requests.get(
		url,
		headers={
			"Authorization": "Bearer " + SPOTIFY_TOKEN
		}
	)

	data = r.json()

	print(r)
	print(f"Fetched {len(data["items"])} song ids from offset {data["offset"]}")

	# Iterate through every item - can be a track or something else
	for item in data["items"]:
		# Validate if item is a track
		if "track" not in item or item["track"] == None:
			print(f"Warning: item at offset {data["offset"]} does not have a valid track object", item)
		else:
			spotify_track_ids.append(item["track"]["id"])

	# If there are more songs we still need to access
	if "next" in data and data["next"] != None:
		recursively_get_spotify_track_ids_from_playlist(url=data["next"])
		time.sleep(0.5)

	else:
		print("Done fetching song ids")

# Fetch all songs from playlist
recursively_get_spotify_track_ids_from_playlist()

# Now go through every track id and add to liked songs in increments of 50 (that is maximum)
batched_track_ids = []

for track_id in spotify_track_ids:
	batched_track_ids.append(track_id)

	if len(batched_track_ids) >= 49:
		like_song_ids(batched_track_ids)
		batched_track_ids = []
		time.sleep(0.5)

if len(batched_track_ids) > 0:
	like_song_ids(batched_track_ids)
	batched_track_ids = []
	time.sleep(0.5)

```

Once you run this, it will dump the contents of your playlist into your Liked Songs collection. And now, you finally have the Liked Songs collection of your dreams!

## Conclusion

It took a bit of work, but at last we were able to create the Liked Songs collection based on what we listened to throughout the years.

One major downside to the approach I‚Äôve outlined throughout this post is the heavy reliance on Last.fm. Not many people use the site, and even if you start now, it would take some time for it to build up the scrobbles (the same dilemma we faced when we wanted a Liked Songs collection).

One potential solution that could make something like this more accessible to all Spotify users is by [requesting your entire listening history from Spotify](https://support.stats.fm/docs/import/spotify-import/) and then processing the raw data from Spotify in a fashion similar to how we processed our raw Last.fm scrobbles. Interestingly, the same person who created lastfmstats.com also created [spotifystats.app](http://spotifystats.app), which could be a potential source to use to make the raw Spotify data more friendly to process. Additionally, we probably wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with the issue of finding Spotify URIs as Spotify should provide them within the data. This is all speculation since I didn‚Äôt go this route, but it could be an interesting path to pursue.

I have open-sourced the three scripts I used in this post. You can check them out at [Armster15/liked-songs-shenanigans-scripts](https://github.com/Armster15/liked-songs-shenanigans-scripts)
