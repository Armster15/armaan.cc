If you need a captcha that not only helps prevent bots from spamming your website but also want a
captcha that respects privacy, hCaptcha is an awesome service. This tutorial will show step by step
how to integrate hCaptcha into your Flask application.

## Setting up our hCaptcha account

First, we need to setup an hCaptcha account to get our credentials to integrate hCaptcha with our website.
Head over to https://hcaptcha.com and make an account and go to its dashboard.

Once we make an account, you should be greeted to a dashboard like this

<Image src={hCaptchaDashboardOverviewImg} alt="The home page of the hCaptcha dashboard" />

Click on the "Sites" tab on the top left corner (next to the "Overview" and "Settings" tab). You should see a site.

<Image src={hCaptchaDashboardSitesImg} alt="The Sites page of the hCaptcha dashboard" />

Click on the "Settings" button where your site is. Now this is where your sitekey will be. Store your sitekey
somewhere now as we are going to need it later.

Now that we have retrieved our sitekey, we need to get our Secret Key. Go to the "Settings" tab.

Your secret key should be in the Settings tab. Store it somewhere, as we are going
to be needing it.

## Installing `Flask-xCaptcha`

Flask-xCaptcha is a Python library that allows us to seamlessly integrate captchas into our Flask applications.

Its PyPi page is https://pypi.org/project/Flask-xCaptcha/,

Its GitHub at https://github.com/benjilev08/flask-xcaptcha

Installing it is a breeze. In your Terminal, just run

```bash
pip install Flask-xCaptcha
```

## Actually coding our Flask app

Lets make a basic Flask app with a simple form:

```py title="app.py"
from flask import *
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def home():
  if request.method == "GET":
    return render_template("index.html")

app.run()
```

```html title="templates/index.html"
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>hCaptcha Demo</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form method="POST">
      <label for="text_input">Name</label>
      <input type="text" id="text_input" name="text_input" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now that we have a basic app.py and template, lets actually add the hCaptcha integration!

First, lets import the `XCaptcha` class from our package we just installed

```py
from flask_xcaptcha import XCaptcha
```

Next, lets set our app config variables to these parameters

```py
app.config['XCAPTCHA_SITE_KEY'] = "SITE KEY GOES HERE"
app.config['XCAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY'] = "SECRET KEY GOES HERE"
app.config['XCAPTCHA_VERIFY_URL'] = "https://hcaptcha.com/siteverify"
app.config['XCAPTCHA_API_URL'] = "https://hcaptcha.com/1/api.js"
app.config['XCAPTCHA_DIV_CLASS'] = "h-captcha"
```

And finally, create an object from our XCaptcha class:

```py
xcaptcha = XCaptcha(app=app)
```

Your app.py file should now look something like this

```diff lang="py" title="app.py"
from flask import *
+from flask_xcaptcha import XCaptcha

app = Flask(__name__)

+app.config['XCAPTCHA_SITE_KEY'] = "SITE KEY GOES HERE"
+app.config['XCAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY'] = "SECRET KEY GOES HERE"
+app.config['XCAPTCHA_VERIFY_URL'] = "https://hcaptcha.com/siteverify"
+app.config['XCAPTCHA_API_URL'] = "https://hcaptcha.com/1/api.js"
+app.config['XCAPTCHA_DIV_CLASS'] = "h-captcha"

+xcaptcha = XCaptcha(app=app)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def home():
  if request.method == "GET":
    return render_template("index.html")

app.run()
```

Now that we have configured our back-end, lets add hCaptcha to our front-end.
This is just a matter of adding one extra line.

```diff lang="html" title="templates/index.html"
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>hCaptcha Demo</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form method="POST">
      <label for="text_input">Name</label>
      <input type="text" id="text_input" name="text_input" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />

+      {{ xcaptcha }}
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

The `{{ xcaptcha }}` line will automatically be converted into an hCaptcha

And that is it! Run your app.py file and see for yourself the rendered hCaptcha!

<Image
  src={hCaptchaInitialDemoImg}
  alt="A screenshot of the rendered HTML which includes our newly created hCaptcha"
/>

## Validating if the user has completed the captcha

This is really easy to do, and it involves just a few extra lines.

```py
xcaptcha.verify()
```

The verify method returns a boolean (True/False) on whether the user
has completed the captcha or not. Implementation is as easy as the following:

```py
if xcaptcha.verify():
  return "You have completed the captcha!"
else:
  return "Please complete the captcha"
```

The complete app.py code:

```diff lang="py" title="app.py"
from flask import *
from flask_xcaptcha import XCaptcha

app = Flask(__name__)

app.config['XCAPTCHA_SITE_KEY'] = "SITE KEY GOES HERE"
app.config['XCAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY'] = "SECRET KEY GOES HERE"
app.config['XCAPTCHA_VERIFY_URL'] = "https://hcaptcha.com/siteverify"
app.config['XCAPTCHA_API_URL'] = "https://hcaptcha.com/1/api.js"
app.config['XCAPTCHA_DIV_CLASS'] = "h-captcha"

xcaptcha = XCaptcha(app=app)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def home():
  if request.method == "GET":
    return render_template("index.html")

+  elif request.method == "POST":
+    if xcaptcha.verify():
+      return "You have completed the captcha!"
+    else:
+      return "Please complete the captcha"

app.run()
```

## Customizing the hCaptcha

Now there are a few ways you can customize the hCaptcha.

If we want to make our captcha dark mode:

```py
app.config['XCAPTCHA_THEME'] = 'dark'
```

This is how a dark mode captcha would look like:

<Image src={hCaptchaDarkModeImg} alt="A screenshot of the hCaptcha in dark mode" />

If we want a compact captcha:

```py
app.config['XCAPTCHA_SIZE'] = 'compact'
```

And this is how a compact captcha looks like:

<Image src={hCaptchaCompactImg} alt="A screenshot of the hCaptcha in compact mode" />

Compact captchas are great if you want the captcha to be suitable for smaller screens.

## Conclusion

And that is how to implement hCaptchas into your Flask application! As we see, the code is
super simple and short and implementing them is a breeze. Not only are you doing yourself
a favor, you are also doing people who visit your website a favor, by using a service that
respects user privacy, so you and your users can feel safe when browsing your website.
